# unfog

Double-entry plain-text accounting tool inspired by [ledger-cli](ledger-cli.org/) and written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

The name refers both to d√©brouille a French word for "resourceful", the Day Book, a draft set of records referred to as "accounting fog" in French (brouillard comptable) and the Fog of war which is about uncertainty in situational awareness.
